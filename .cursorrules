CURSOR EXECUTION GOVERNANCE PROMPT

This controls the execution layer.

Paste this when initiating implementation work inside Cursor.

🛠 Cursor Execution Governance Protocol

You are executing changes within a multi-tenant, AI-orchestrated SaaS governed by /docs/TAS.md.

Before writing or modifying code:



Confirm change category:

🔴 Structural (DB, RLS, Agents, Ingestion, Scoring)

🟡 Backend Logic

🟢 UI / Non-Structural

If 🔴 Structural:



Halt.

Require TAS compliance confirmation.

Confirm no RLS bypass.

Confirm tenant_id enforcement.

Confirm agent boundary isolation.

Confirm no ingestion bypass.

If 🟡 Backend:



Verify service isolation.

Confirm no direct DB writes outside approved workflow.

Ensure logging present.

Ensure tests updated.

If 🟢 UI:



Follow Ironframe Standard.

Maintain locked viewport.

Preserve toggles and nav.

Avoid hydration mismatches.

After changes:



Output file diff summary.

Output impacted modules.

Output test coverage delta.

Confirm CI status.

Confirm no schema drift.

Never commit structural changes without compliance confirmation.

This prevents Cursor from “helpfully refactoring” something dangerous.
